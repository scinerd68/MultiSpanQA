- Viterbi algorithm
- Test IO scheme instead of BIO
- Change BERT with other model RoBERTa, XLNet
- Check if the result is worse with longer sentence
- Model predict each token independently: how to fix this?
- Generative QA for multi span
- CornerNet like implementation (predict start end then match for each span)
- Multi task: answer-generation + predict start end at the same time, match span based on generated answer and predict start end
